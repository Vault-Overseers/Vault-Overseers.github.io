# IDEs

## Intro
An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment and is used for coding. In SS14 this allows you to edit code and then build and run your newly edited code with ease all in one program. There's a variety of free options but popular ones include Visual Studio Community, [Visual Studio Code (VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and JetBrains Rider. We encourage all new contributors to use VSC as it has a [Robust YAML plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slava0135.robust-yaml) to make editing YAML much easier on top of its [YAML language support here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml).

## VSC Setup
1. Head to the Visual Studio Code Website here and run through the installation process. https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install / Enable YAML language support and the Robust YAML plugin linked above.

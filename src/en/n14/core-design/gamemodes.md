# Gamemodes

Gamemodes in Space Station 14 are called `GamePreset`'s and hold all the general information about a gamemode as well as the Game Rules, which presently are an entity prototype with components defining the rules for that mode. This allows a game preset to hold multiple rules.

In Space Station 13/14 gamemodes are often defined by what antagonist or antag is prevelant in that round or mode. For example the revolution or revs gamemode is dominated by revolutionaries the antag.

In Nuclear 14, the base gamemode works on a secret / dynamic mode. Secret meaning the players do not know what the gamemode is, and dynamic meaning game rules can be added as the round progresses to keep things interesting and in response to certain things happening.

The core underlying gamemode is Extended, meaning a focus on roleplay where not every player will have an objective. However certain factions might have objectives which are their own gamerule and objective prototypes, and there may also be a round start prevailing gamemode or antagonist, or one added later on.

# Round Flow

## Early Game
Analogy: starting up the bus.

## Mid Game
Analogy: the wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round (but on a bumpy road)


## Late Game
Analogy: the bus is on fire, blown up, hurtling down a mountain side, with a nuclear bomb in the back, covered in bullet holes and cognitohazards (or its an agenda completion, and everything is fine and it gets to its destination)
